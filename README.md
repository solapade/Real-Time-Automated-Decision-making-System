# Real-Time-Automated-Decision-making-System
The purpose of this project was to make real-time investment decisions on 10 different currency pairs e.g., EUR-USD every 6 minutes.
Investment strategy was first built based on historical data collected over 24 hours for 10 different currency pairs. This was done by computing Average price, return, standard deviation, moving average using 5 data points and Bollinger bands for 1.25 standard deviations for 6 minutes (360 data points) aggregate data. I observed that when we had 3 consecutive positive returns, then the value of the currency pairs crossed the upper Bollinger Band in 30% of the cases. Based on this strategy, I decided to build my investment strategy around selling after 3 consecutive positive returns and buying after 3 consecutive negative returns else, no decision was made.
Real-time granular data (1 second) was then collected from Polygon.com for 10 different currency pairs and saved in a database. Based on the strategy, decisions were made in real time, every six minutes to sell, buy or do nothing. Profit and Loss was also computed every 6 minutes.
